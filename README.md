Refactoring Demo
================

Welcome! This is the project accompanying my brief talk on Refactoring. During the talk, I focus on refactoring the code residing in one large method. The raw, "before" code can be found in the `starting-point` branch, my "after" code can be found in the "refactoring-first-attempt", and my live demo "after" code will can be found in the "live-demo" branch.

Getting started
---------------

If you just want the code, you may either browse my commit history in the browser (which provides excellent diff visualization), or click the "Zip" button to download the source for whichever branch you want to see (`master`, `starting-point`, `refactoring-first-attempt`).

Once you have the source on your machine, please grab the NuGet packages for this project locally.

If you do not have a NUnit test runner, install the "NUnit Test Adapter" package from the Visual Studio Gallery.
